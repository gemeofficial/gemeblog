## Summary

Both Lomi and [GEME](/) are solid options for those looking to reduce food waste. However, GEME stands out in terms of its higher capacity, 
continuous operation, and ability to handle more challenging waste materials like meat, dairy, and manure. On the other hand, 
Lomi shines with its compact, sleek design and gift friendly looking and package.

Actually Lomi is one of those [dehydrate food recycler](/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-geme-composter-and-other-electric-kitchen-composters) appliances, they shows up popular in the marketing. 
In deed those 
machines can help reducing people's food waste, but they should not call composters as they did not create compost at all.
However, this [composter marketing is a bit chao](/blog/geme-is-calling-for-industry-standards-for-composters) at the current moment. I hope this article helps you.
