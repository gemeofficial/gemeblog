After [IFA 2024 event](https://www.geme.bio/ifa) in Berlin, GEME team get a lot of inquiries and partnership cooperation.
Some of the people ask us, there is a new brand called **Soilkind** also in the IFA exhibition.

but vary in their technology and functionality. 
We will have a detailed commonalities and differences breakdown to compare and check.

## Note

At the moment of 26th September, all info of soilkind are from [kicksterter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mykalea/kalea-turns-kitchen-waste-into-real-compost-in-only-48h/comments) and it's official website.

Soilkind was the original called mykalea, somehow it rebrand as Soilkind and under [Karcher](https://www.karcher.com/ph/inside-kaercher/kaercher-stories/make-compost-not-waste.html).
The origin website mykalea.de(https://www.mykalea.de) is now not accessible.

It's always not easy for innovation, and we hope soilkind and make a success and the Kickstarter backers can get satisfied eventually.
