# How to avoid stinky compost pile

Composting is actually a process in which aerobic microorganisms break down biological waste. Therefore, you should give 
your compost pile plenty of oxygen.

If your compost pile starts to rot and stink, it is a reminder that your compost pile is in an oxygen deficient state.

In an anaerobic environment (lack of air), bacteria produce odorous ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, as well as methane gas,
which is harmful to the climate. At this point, your compost pile will emit an unpleasant odor.

In contrast, aerobically active compost piles do not have an unpleasant odor, but rather smell like fresh air in a woodland.

In an aerobic environment, not only will decomposition be faster, but the production of climate-damaging methane gas can 
be largely avoided.

So how can you keep your compost pile from stinking? The method is simple.

1. Turn the pile frequently to keep your compost pile full of oxygen

2. Avoid overly wet compost piles, shade your compost pile when it rains. If your compost pile is too wet, then you should 
increase the number of times you turn your pile.

3. Pile your compost pile in the right way (see Building your compost pile for details)

4. Use GEME to make composting easier and faster.

The GEME is a complete restoration of the natural composting process, and the natural heat-resistant microbiota
[GEME-Kobold](/geme-kobold) used in conjunction with it is known to contain 48 species of beneficial microorganisms 
that are responsible for the almost odorless decomposition of bio-waste.

In addition to that, GEME is equipped with mixed deodorization and sterilization system:
The first layer of sterilization and deodorization.
The second layer further decomposes and absorbs odor components.
The third layer removes the residual odor components.

So by using [GEME](/product/geme) for composting, you will not only get highly active organic compost in 6-8 hours, 
but you will avoid the huge workload of turning the pile and the possible bad smell and pollution of the atmosphere.

Start your easy and pleasant home composting now! Your kitchen will be free from the stench of garbage from now on.
