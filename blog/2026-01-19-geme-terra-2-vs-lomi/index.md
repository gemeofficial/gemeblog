## Quick Verdict (TL;DR)

| Feature | GEME Terra 2 | Mill (Gen 2) |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Processing model | **Continuous (daily throughput)** | **Batch-based** |
| Published capacity | **Up to 2kg per day** | **6.5L bucket (fills over weeks)** |
| Output | **Bio-compost (soil-ready)** | **Dried “Food Grounds” (not compost)** |
| Filter cost | **$0 (permanent filter)** | $89 per replacement |
| Subscription required | **No** | Optional / ecosystem-based |
| Best for | Ownership, low maintenance | Service-based users |

## What This Comparison Is (and Isn’t)

- ✅ Based on **official product pages & support documentation**
- ✅ Focused on **real-world ownership and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
- ❌ Not sponsored
- ❌ Not lab testing — specs and statements only

## Capacity Model — Daily Throughput vs Batch Cycles

### GEME Terra 2 Capacity

GEME Terra 2 publishes a **daily processing capacity of up to 2kg per day**.  
Because it uses a **continuous biological breakdown process**, waste can be added at any time — there is no “lockout” period during operation.

Key points:
- Up to **2kg/day** published capacity
- **19L internal chamber**
- Continuous feed, 24/7 operation

This model favors households that cook frequently or generate food waste daily.

---

### Mill Capacity

Mill uses a **batch-style bucket system**:
- **6.5L bucket**
- Designed to **fill over up to 4 weeks**
- Waste is dried and ground once the cycle runs

Mill does not publish a daily throughput figure. Instead, capacity is described in terms of **container volume and fill time**.

---

### Capacity Verdict

If you think in **daily food waste volume**, Terra 2’s model is clearer.  
If you prefer **accumulating waste and processing it periodically**, Mill aligns better.

---

## Output Reality — Compost vs Food Grounds

### What Does Mill Produce?

Mill produces dried, ground food waste referred to as **“Food Grounds.”**

According to Mill’s own support documentation:
> **“Food Grounds aren’t compost.”**

The output is a dehydrated biomass intended for storage, pickup, or secondary use — **not finished compost**.

---

### What Does GEME Terra 2 Produce?

GEME Terra 2 produces **biologically reduced compost**:
- **Up to 95% volume reduction**
- Compost can be harvested **every 1–2 months**
- Output is suitable for soil amendment

This distinction matters if your goal is **actual compost**, not just waste drying.

---

### Output Verdict

- Want **soil-ready compost at home** → **GEME Terra 2**
- Want **dehydrated waste for storage or pickup** → **Mill**

## Recurring Costs & Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

### Mill Ongoing Costs

Depending on how Mill is used, ongoing costs may include:
- **Rental plan:** ~$35/month
- **Carbon filter replacements:** $89
- **Optional pickup service:** ~$192/year

These costs vary by user, but they are part of Mill’s ecosystem-based model.

---

### GEME Terra 2 Ongoing Costs

- **One-time device purchase**
- **Permanent catalytic filter**
- **No required subscriptions**
- **No mandatory recurring fees**

---

### Cost Verdict

If you prefer **predictable, one-time ownership**, Terra 2 is simpler.  
If you’re comfortable with **service-based pricing**, Mill may fit your expectations.

---

## Which One Fits Your Kitchen?

### Choose Mill if:
- You want **Food Grounds + optional mail-back service**
- You’re comfortable with **filters, rentals, or service fees**
- Your food waste volume is relatively low and infrequent

### Choose GEME Terra 2 if:
- You want **real compost output**
- You cook often and generate daily food waste
- You want **no subscriptions and minimal long-term cost**

---

## Common Buyer Mistakes to Avoid

### Confusing “Dehydration” with Composting
Drying food waste reduces smell and volume — but it does not equal compost.

### Ignoring Recurring Costs
Filters and services may seem small monthly, but add up over time.

### Mismatching Capacity Models
Batch systems and continuous systems behave very differently in daily use.

---

## FAQ

### Is GEME Terra 2 really 2kg per day?
Yes. GEME publishes **“up to 2kg/day”** as its daily processing capacity.

### Does Mill make compost?
No. Mill explicitly states that **Food Grounds are not compost**.

### Does GEME require filter replacements?
No. GEME uses a **permanent metal-ion catalytic filter**.

### Is GEME suitable for apartments?
Yes. It is floor-standing, quiet, and designed for indoor use.

---

## Final Decision Rule

If your priority is **ownership, compost output, and zero recurring fees**,  
**GEME Terra 2** is the clearer long-term solution.

If your priority is **service convenience and managed waste logistics**,  
**Mill** may better fit your lifestyle.
