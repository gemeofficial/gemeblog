Choosing a kitchen composter isn’t just about convenience — it’s about **capacity, output reality, and long-term cost**.

This guide compares [**GEME Terra 2 vs Mill (Gen 2)**](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=best-kitchen-composter-2026) using only published specifications and official support statements, so you can decide which system actually fits your kitchen and budget.

### The 90-Second Truth: The "Lazy" Owner vs. The Service Subscriber

::: Note
By "Lazy", we mean low-maintenance: fewer trips to the bin, fewer fees, and fewer rules.
:::

 1. Mill (2nd gen.) dries and grinds scraps into “Food Grounds.” Mill support explicitly states Food Grounds aren’t compost. 

 2. Mill pricing model includes purchase (\$999+) or rental (\$35/mo). Recurring costs include filters (\$89) and optional pickups (\$192/yr). 

 3. GEME Terra 2 provides up to 2kg/day continuous capacity, with 95% waste reduction allowing harvest intervals of 1–2 months.

## Quick Verdict (TL;DR)

| Feature | GEME Terra 2 | Mill (Gen 2) |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Processing model | **Continuous (daily throughput)** | **Batch-based** |
| Published capacity | **Up to 2kg per day** | **6.5L bucket (fills over weeks)** |
| Output | **Bio-compost (soil-ready)** | **Dried “Food Grounds” (not compost)** |
| Filter cost | **$0 (permanent filter)** | $89 per replacement |
| Subscription required | **No** | Optional / ecosystem-based |
| Best for | Ownership, low maintenance | Service-based users |

## What This Comparison Is (and Isn’t)

- ✅ Based on **official product pages & support documentation**
- ✅ Focused on **real-world ownership and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
- ❌ Not sponsored
- ❌ Not lab testing — specs and statements only

## Capacity Model — Daily Throughput vs Batch Cycles

### GEME Terra 2 Capacity

GEME Terra 2 publishes a **daily processing capacity of up to 2kg per day**.  
Because it uses a **continuous biological breakdown process**, waste can be added at any time — there is no “lockout” period during operation.

Key points:
- Up to **2kg/day** published capacity
- **19L internal chamber**
- Continuous feed, 24/7 operation

This model favors households that cook frequently or generate food waste daily.

---

### Mill Capacity

Mill uses a **batch-style bucket system**:
- **6.5L bucket**
- Designed to **fill over up to 4 weeks**
- Waste is dried and ground once the cycle runs

Mill does not publish a daily throughput figure. Instead, capacity is described in terms of **container volume and fill time**.

---

### Capacity Verdict

If you think in **daily food waste volume**, Terra 2’s model is clearer.  
If you prefer **accumulating waste and processing it periodically**, Mill aligns better.

---

## Output Reality — Compost vs Food Grounds

|                   | **Mill (2nd Gen.)**                                  | **GEME Terra 2**                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Output            | Dried "Food Grounds"                             | Bio-compost (up to 95% reduction)        |
| Compost Status    | **"Food Grounds aren't compost."** It Needs pickup or further composting | **Ready for soil amendment**                 |
| Harvest Frequency | When bucket fills / after each drying cycle      | Once every 1–2 months                    |

### What Does Mill Produce?

Mill produces dried, ground food waste referred to as **“Food Grounds.”**

According to Mill’s own support documentation:
> **“Food Grounds aren’t compost.”**

The output is a dehydrated biomass intended for storage, pickup, or secondary use — **not finished compost**.

---

### What Does GEME Terra 2 Produce?

GEME Terra 2 produces **biologically reduced compost**:
- **Up to 95% volume reduction**
- Compost can be harvested **every 1–2 months**
- Output is suitable for soil amendment

This distinction matters if your goal is **actual compost**, not just waste drying.

---

### Output Verdict

- Want **soil-ready compost at home** → **GEME Terra 2**
- Want **dehydrated waste for storage or pickup** → **Mill**

## Recurring Costs & Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

### Mill Ongoing Costs

Depending on how Mill is used, ongoing costs may include:
- **Rental plan:** ~\$35/month
- **Carbon filter replacements:** \$89
- **Optional pickup service:** ~\$192/year

These costs vary by user, but they are part of Mill’s ecosystem-based model.

---

### GEME Terra 2 Ongoing Costs

- **One-time device purchase**
- **Permanent catalytic filter**
- **No required subscriptions**
- **No mandatory recurring fees**

---

### Cost Verdict

If you prefer **predictable, one-time ownership**, Terra 2 is simpler.  
If you’re comfortable with **service-based pricing**, Mill may fit your expectations.

Mill involves potential recurring costs for rental (\$35/mo), filters (\$89), or pickups (\$192/yr). GEME has zero mandatory recurring fees.

## Which One Fits Your Kitchen?

### Choose Mill if:
- You want **Food Grounds + optional mail-back service**
- You’re comfortable with **filters, rentals, or service fees**
- You like the “fill over weeks” bucket model (6.5L / up to 4 weeks to fill).

### Choose GEME Terra 2 if:
- You want **real compost output**
- You cook often and generate daily food waste
- You want **no subscriptions and minimal long-term cost**
- You want long intervals between harvest (1–2 months) via **95% reduction**

---

## FAQ

### Is GEME Terra 2 really 2kg per day?
Yes. GEME publishes **“up to 2kg/day”** as its daily processing capacity.

### Does Mill make compost?
No. Mill explicitly states that **Food Grounds are not compost**.

### Does GEME require filter replacements?
No. GEME uses a **permanent Metal-Ion Catalytic filter**. Unlike charcoal filters, it does not require periodic replacement. 

### What are the annual costs for Mill?
It depends on your plan. Rentals are ~\$420/year (\$35/mo). Filter replacements are listed at \$89. Optional pickup service is \$192/year. 

### How often do I need to empty GEME?
Official guidance states waste volume is reduced by 95%, allowing you to harvest compost just once every 1–2 months. 

### Is GEME suitable for apartments?
Yes. It is floor-standing, quiet, and designed for indoor use.

### Can I put bones in GEME?
Small bones (chicken/fish) are accepted. Large beef/pork bones should be avoided as they take too long to break down biologically.

### Does Mill require a subscription?
You can buy the device upfront (\$999+), but the ecosystem (pickups, filters) is designed around recurring services/purchases.

## Practical Decision Rules

### 1. The “Output Truth” Rule
If you specifically want “compost,” note Mill’s own definition: Food Grounds aren’t compost. If you want compost positioning + harvest intervals, Terra 2 states 95% reduction and 1–2 month harvest. 

### 2. The “Fees Tolerance” Rule
If recurring costs annoy you, audit the full stack: rental + filters + optional pickups. If you’re fine with that, Mill can make sense. 

### 3. The “Capacity Model” Rule
Terra 2 publishes a daily capacity (up to 2kg/day). Mill describes a bucket capacity that fills over weeks (6.5L; up to 4 weeks). Choose the model that matches your cooking rhythm.
