# What is the Difference Between GEME Composter and Other Electric Kitchen Composters?



![GEME vs Other Composters](./img/img.png)


Many people ask us this question many times. I think this question worth for a blog to explain it.

GEME Composter is the world's easiest way for home composting, it is challanging any other products so far by 2023. 
GEME is the world's only one product that use biotchenology method for real composting in Amazon online stores.

Although all of these similar products share the same mission: food waste recycling.

However, all others are dehydrating based composter, they are not really do composting.

<!-- truncate -->

Most of these units are more like bread makers, shred the food waste into pieces, cook at high temperatures, and eventually 
dehydrate the food waste and make them looks like compost or soil.

While GEME simulates the natural biological decompose process, by choosing the best micribes and providing the best environemnt.
Making the whole process quickly and comfortable indoor.

Let me breakdown the difference in several aspects.


## Technology

Among all other differences, this one is the most important one. GEME uses totally hardcore biotechnology that other 
products can not follow. You can simply copy the machine, but without the specified microbiota(GEME Kobold). 

The fancy machine is just a piece of junk. GEME's key competition is not the hardware, but the microrganism techonology.

### Comparison

GEME use biotechonology to breakdown the foodwaste, it's real composting method. It was similar to fermentation, 
but fermentation is anaerobic while composting is aerobic. 
Inside GEME there is an oxygen system that makes the aerobic process happen and provides the best environment.

While other products like Lomi, produce only cooked waste, they just looks like compost, but actually not.

Mr Robert Pavlis discussed this in this [great article](https://www.gardenmyths.com/lomi-electronic-composter/), 
very detailed. Note, the team seems aware of this and start calling their byproduct as pre-compost or lomi-compost, 
whatever created words that make it misleading.

More reviews for those machines use the same technology as a bread maker.

| **Plant Growth Review** | There was a company a few years ago who promised one of these but it never got off the ground (pun intended). I do a lot of gardening and use outdoor composting for old plants, dead and rotten veggies. I also do a lot of food processing, cooking and canning and end up with a lot of bits I oftento feed to my dogs (which I still do) but I still ended up putting a lot in the outdoor compost.I now used The Geme for inside scraps as it creates compost 100x faster that the outdoor composters. Outdoor composters usually take 3 to 4 seasons here in Northern New England as it's only warm about a quarter of the year. The GEME creates beautiful compost/soil in a few days.Fertilizer has got so crazy expensive in the last few years this will def same me money over the years!

It grew mold([Source Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT4A5SA39WQNQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3FSQTRS)). Lomi does not work!! it's a glorified food processor that takes forever to process the compost and smells HORRIBLE while running. The "dirt" it produces IS NOT DIRT. You have to mix it 10:1 with actual dirt to use it on plants - which isn't widely publicized. I mixed in the Lomi dirt with my plant's dirt and it killed several plants!! Please spare yourself and don't buy this - huge waste of money([Source Llink](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WTJZIQ4YVM6Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3FSQTRS)). This killed two of my plants. Customer service is a joke . All form letter crap! Tons on influencers on the pay role! Have to run 3-4 cycles to get soil dry. When asked for help they told me I needed to put better garbage in the lomi ! WTH!!! I eat a ton of organic vegetables from my garden but Nnnoooooooo! I need to put better garbage in the lomi. What ! I will just pick the food and put it straight in the lomi! Skip the hype!([Source Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B6CG69LJE3PE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3FSQTRS))|

### Conclusion

:::success
GEME's ByProduct is the organic compost, not cooked waste.
:::

## Noise 

Both GEME Composter and other Lomi-like dehydrators use electricity to power up the machine.

However, GEME's electric energy only provides the best environment for microbes to work. Hence it is silent when running.

While other units need electricity power to drive the shreder and high temperature to cut food waste into pieces and cook 
them soft and then shredden to powder shape, making them looks like soil. You will hear noises like dish washers or a 
gridder when they start to work.

| **Reviews**                   | I love that I don't have to go out to my compost bin outside. My food scraps are turned into wonderful organic compost. No smell, works fast.

You cannot even be in the same room as the thing without earplugs. Seriously, it sounds like an airplane engine!

GEME's much more silent when working mode. You can even put it in the living room.

## Cleaning

GEME Composter requries no cleaning work at all, it is continues feeding design. That means you can keep adding it 
multiple times, since the waste will be reduced to 5% and a very small size is left. It will be quite long time to wait 
until the bin is full. Other dehydrators are cycle based design. Every time you use it, you need to take it out, wash it, 
and clean up, just like dish washing process and more troublesome!
