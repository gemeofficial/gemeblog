Worse part is when people believe they get a unit large enough, but when they buy it home, it turns out the volume is similar to
some countertop "composter" units. It reminds me the old time when we having [sumeshi](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%85%A2%E9%A3%AF)
in asian restaurant.

## Mill's marketing strategy

Mill is an advanced dehydrator, similar to [Lomi we compared before](/blog/lomi-vs-geme-composter).
While it does not claim itself as composter in it's website, they call it's output "**Food Grounds**".

However, it is still running a lot of "composter" ad words for marketing.

![Mill use Composter as ad words](./img/img_1.png)

Which is very confusing.

## Summary

Both the Mill Food Recycler and the GEME Composter provide excellent solutions for reducing food waste, but they target different user needs.

The **GEME Composter** excels with its larger capacity, ability to handle tougher waste materials like meat and dairy,
and continuous operation without needing to wait for cycles to finish. This makes it ideal for larger families or small businesses.
In contrast, the **Mill Food Recycler** is better suited for smaller households, offering a compact design and ease of use,
though it produces dehydrated food waste that still requires further composting to create usable soil.

I hope this comparison helps you make an informed decision about which composter best fits your lifestyle!
