## 1. Understanding Egg Shelf Life

### Factors That Affect Egg Longevity

Several factors influence how long eggs remain fresh:

- Storage Temperature: Eggs kept in a cold, stable fridge last significantly longer.
- Packaging Date: Eggs closer to their packing date last longer than those closer to expiration.
- Handling Practices: Frequent handling or temperature changes reduce freshness.
- Type of Egg: Farm-fresh and commercial eggs differ in coating and treatment, impacting shelf life.

### Difference Between Store-Bought and Farm Eggs

- Store-Bought Eggs: Washed and sanitized, removing the protective cuticle. This makes refrigeration critical.
- Farm-Fresh Eggs: Often unwashed and can be stored at room temperature for a short time due to the intact cuticle.

### Refrigerated vs. Room Temperature Storage

In the U.S., refrigeration is a must due to washing and sanitization practices. At room temperature, eggs spoil much quicker — often in just 1–2 weeks. In contrast, refrigerated eggs can last 4–5 weeks or longer past the pack date.

## 2. Do Eggs Expire? Myths vs. Facts

### Expiration Date vs. Sell-By vs. Best-By Labels

Understanding the labels can be confusing:

- Sell-By Date: Meant for retailers, not consumers.
- Expiration Date: A general guide, not an exact spoilage point.
- Best-By Date: Suggests peak freshness, not safety.

In many cases, eggs are perfectly usable 2–3 weeks past their labeled expiration date — if stored properly.

### What Happens When Eggs Expire?

Expired eggs don't necessarily turn toxic overnight. Over time, moisture and gases escape through the shell, making them:
- Runny and watery
- More alkaline (less acidic)
- [**Prone to bacterial contamination**](/blog/egg-recall-salmonella-2025-best-way-to-kill-salmonella-in-eggs-recalled)

⚠️ **That's why regular checks are important.** 

## 3. How to Tell When Eggs Go Bad

### The Float Test Explained

**A classic method to check egg freshness**:

1. Fill a bowl with water.
2. Gently place the egg inside.

- Fresh eggs: Sink and lay flat.
- Older eggs: Stand upright.
- Bad eggs: Float to the top due to increased air cell size.

### Sight, Smell, and Sound Clues

- Sight: Look for cloudy whites, pinkish or greenish hues—signs of bacterial growth.
- Smell: A rotten egg smell is unmistakable. If it smells off, toss it.
- Sound: A sloshing sound inside the shell might indicate a breakdown in structure.

### Cracked Shells and Odd Colors

**Avoid using eggs with**:

- Cracks or oozing
- Mold or powdery residue
- Unusual yolk colors (e.g., green, grey)
