## 1. Bringing New Solutions To Reducing Waste At Home 

[**GEME Terra 2**](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=geme-terra-2-debuts) weighs only 13 kg but has a 14 L capacity, making it easy to handle up to 3 kg of daily food waste. Its dimensions (11.7 × 17.2 × 22.3 inches) make composting at home accessible for modern families and households of three or fewer persons. 

[On December 9th, the GEME Terra II pre-orders sold out in just 10 hours, with hundreds of units snapped up by eager gardeners – the response was incredible](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=geme-terra-2-debuts)! It's been such a thrill to see how much our customers have been waiting for a solution like this.

### GEME Terra 2 Fits 78% US Households

According to [Statista's Household Size Survey](https://www.statista.com/statistics/242189/disitribution-of-households-in-the-us-by-household-size/), in 2024, more than 78% of U.S. households consisted of three people or fewer. That said, the smaller design of [**GEME Terra 2** can help over 78% of US households achieve better food waste management, leaving more space in their homes and thus reducing carbon footprint and cutting greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=geme-terra-2-debuts).

## 2. Revolutionise Your Composting Experience

Unlike those dehydrators on the market (which claim to be composters), GEME Terra 2 rapidly breaks down food waste into rich compost by microbial fermentation, making traditional yard composting a thing of the past. It handles all your waste right where it's generated, saving time and effort. 

What can be marked as the most intelligent countertop composter is that it automatically adjusts internal conditions, ensuring optimal composting without any manual intervention. You don't have to consider carbon-nitrogen ratios or turning piles as you used to, because GEME Terra 2 now takes care of everything for you. You can definitely rest assured that your food waste will be turned into nutrients for your garden and plants. 

![GEME Terra 2 Composting At Home](./img/geme-terra-2-composting-at-home.jpg)

Furthermore, the advanced technology of GEME Terra 2 features real-time monitoring, making composting at home much more engaging. The high-precision sensors track temperature, humidity, and pH, automatically adjusting for perfect compost. As with the first-generation GEME composter, the permanent filter doesn't need replacements, ensuring hassle-free maintenance and continuous operation. 

At IFA 2024, GEME Composter Terra II was highlighted by [Jon Bitner](https://www.digitaltrends.com/users/jon-bitner/) as one of "[The best smart home tech of IFA 2024](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/ifa-2024-best-smart-home/)".

## 3. User-Friendly and Safe Composting

Still, the GEME Terra 2 retains its energy-saving, silent, and odour-free property, just like the first model. It's designed for convenience and comfort in any home environment. Also, personalised notifications of GEME Terra 2 boost optimal performance, making composting easier than ever. 

Considering the safety of children, GEME Terra 2 features a Child Lock, ensuring a safe composting process for families. Another new feature is the Digital Display, which provides easy-to-read information on composting status and alerts, keeping you informed at just a glance.

## 4. The Urgency of Reducing Food Waste
In the United States, 31% (133 billion pounds) of the 430 billion pounds of available food supply at the retail and consumer levels in 2010 went uneaten, according to the [report from the USDA by Jean C. Buzby, Hodan Farah Wells and Jeffrey Hyman](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details?pubid=43836). 

In 2018, 24% of all municipal waste generated in the EU was landfilled. As [the European Commission report](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling_en) indicates, landfill waste can have dangerous effects on human health and on the environment. The average European produces 5 tons of waste each year. In contrast, only 38% of waste in the EU is recycled, and over 60% of household waste still ends up in landfills in some EU countries. 

According to [the EU's waste hierarchy](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-framework-directive_en), landfilling is the least preferable option and should be limited to the necessary minimum. Whether in the US or the EU, governments are committed to reducing food waste from retailers to individuals, including introducing [methods of composting organic waste at home](https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home) and setting out [laws to limit the share of municipal waste landfilled to 10% by 2035](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202501892&qid=1763688194910). Solutions like GEME Terra II help households take meaningful action at the source.

## 5. Let's Feed The Earth

Vivian, CEO of GEME, shared her concept:" With our first generation, we proved that composting could be effortless. But with Terra II, we want to change the mindset entirely.

For centuries, humans have been 'takers'—we take food from the soil and give back only plastic and pollution. The philosophy behind Terra II is simple yet profound: Let's feed the earth.

By making the device smaller, smarter, and more accessible, we are democratising this act of care. We don't want sustainability to be a luxury for the few; we want it to be a daily ritual for the many. I hope that Terra II turns every kitchen into a source of nourishment for our planet, closing the loop from table to soil, and reminding us that when we feed the earth, we are ultimately feeding ourselves."
