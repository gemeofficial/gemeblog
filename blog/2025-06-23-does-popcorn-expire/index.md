## Understanding Popcorn Shelf Life
What is popcorn made of, and why does that matter
Popcorn kernels are whole grains containing moisture trapped within a hard shell. 

That tiny bit of moisture (about 14%) is essential ‚Äî it's what makes the kernel explode into fluffy popcorn. Over time, however, moisture can escape, and without it, popcorn won‚Äôt pop properly.

### Factors affecting popcorn‚Äôs shelf stability

Several elements impact how long your popcorn lasts:
- Moisture exposure (causes mold or drying)

- Air exposure (leads to staleness)
- Heat and sunlight (break down natural oils and flavourings)
- Type of popcorn (popped, unpopped, microwave)

## How Long Does Unpopped Popcorn Last?
### Shelf life of standard kernels vs. microwave popcorn
- Unpopped popcorn: Up to 1‚Äì2 years if sealed and stored in a dry place.

- Microwave popcorn: Typically has a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date 6‚Äì12 months after manufacture. It can be safe to use a couple of months beyond that, but quality may decline.

### Signs your unpopped kernels have gone bad
- They no longer pop

- Kernels smell rancid
- Visible mold or discolouration
- Dry and cracked surfaces

## Does Popped Popcorn Expire?
 Storage methods and timeframes

### Freshly popped popcorn:
- Open air: 1‚Äì2 days before it gets stale

- Airtight container: 1‚Äì2 weeks
- Vacuum-sealed: up to 2 months

### What makes popped popcorn stale or unsafe?
- Exposure to air = loss of crispness

- Butter and flavourings = spoilage
- Humidity = mold risk

## Does Microwave Popcorn Go Bad?
 Ingredients that expire first.
### Microwave popcorn contains:
- Butter/oil-based flavourings (can turn rancid)

- Preservatives (eventually lose effectiveness)
- Salt and seasonings (can degrade in taste)
 How to assess quality after the expiration date

## More Tips for Extending Popcorn Shelf Life
Proper popcorn storage isn‚Äôt just about preventing spoilage‚Äîit‚Äôs about maintaining the best taste and popping performance over time. Here are some additional strategies to make your popcorn last longer:
### Use Oxygen Absorbers
For long-term storage of kernels, adding oxygen absorbers to your airtight container can drastically reduce oxidation, helping to preserve freshness.
### Store in Small Batches
Instead of opening a large container every time, divide your kernels into smaller airtight bags or jars. This prevents constant air exposure and keeps the majority of your popcorn fresh.
### Avoid Refrigeration
Refrigerating unpopped kernels can cause moisture imbalance, leading to poor popping results. Room temperature is best‚Äîcool, dry, and dark locations are ideal.
