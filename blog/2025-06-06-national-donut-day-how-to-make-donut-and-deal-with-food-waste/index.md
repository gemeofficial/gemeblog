## **3. Enjoy Your Donuts but Don‚Äôt Waste Your Food**

It‚Äôs easy to get excited and make too many donuts, especially on a fun holiday like **National Donut Day**. But while it's great to indulge, we should always try to avoid food waste.

### **Here‚Äôs Why Not Wasting Food Matters:**

- Wasting food means wasting money.

- It also wastes the resources used to grow and transport the food.

- Food waste creates harmful gases in landfills that hurt our planet.

### **Tips to Avoid Wasting Donuts and Other Food:**

#### **1.** **Make Only What You Need**

Plan ahead. If you're cooking for just a few people, cut the recipe in half.

#### **2.** **Store Leftovers Properly**

Keep leftover donuts in an airtight container.

You can freeze donuts for later‚Äîjust reheat in the microwave or oven.

#### **3.** **Share With Others**

Give extra donuts to neighbors or friends. Share the joy!

#### **4.** **Compost Extra Donuts For Garden Soil**

If you just have 2 or 3 donuts left, try to break it down in a home composter to make rich-nutrient compost for your garden. This is the most eco-friendly way to celebrate the holiday.

Remember, a little planning goes a long way in making sure we enjoy our food **without wasting it**.

**Food waste management** isn‚Äôt just about saving money‚Äîit‚Äôs about protecting our planet. When food goes in the trash, it doesn‚Äôt just disappear. It ends up in landfills, where it releases **methane**, a powerful greenhouse gas that causes climate change.

### **The Best Way to Manage Food Waste: Use a Composter**

Using a **composter** at home is one of the simplest and most effective ways to turn your food waste into something useful‚Äî**rich compost for your garden**!

### **What Is Composting?**

Composting is the natural process of breaking down organic waste (like banana peels, coffee grounds, and leftover donuts) into a dark, nutrient-rich soil called compost.

### **Why Composting Is Good:**

1. **Improves soil health** in gardens and pots.
2. **Reduces landfill waste**, lowering pollution.
3. **Saves money** on fertilizer.
4. **Supports plants**, helping them grow better and stronger.

4. **Turn the** **GEME home composter on** ‚Äîwithin 6-8 hours, you‚Äôll have dark, crumbly compost ready to use!
