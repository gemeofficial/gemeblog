## **3. Enjoy Your Donuts but Don‚Äôt Waste Your Food**

It‚Äôs easy to get excited and make too many donuts, especially on a fun holiday like **National Donut Day**. But while it's great to indulge, we should always try to avoid food waste.

### **Here‚Äôs Why Not Wasting Food Matters:**

- Wasting food means wasting money.

- It also wastes the resources used to grow and transport the food.

- Food waste creates harmful gases in landfills that hurt our planet.

### **Tips to Avoid Wasting Donuts and Other Food:**

#### **1.** **Make Only What You Need**

Plan ahead. If you're cooking for just a few people, cut the recipe in half.

#### **2.** **Store Leftovers Properly**

Keep leftover donuts in an airtight container.

You can freeze donuts for later‚Äîjust reheat in the microwave or oven.

#### **3.** **Share With Others**

Give extra donuts to neighbors or friends. Share the joy!

#### **4.** **Compost Extra Donuts For Garden Soil**

If you just have 2 or 3 donuts left, try to break it down in a home composter to make rich-nutrient compost for your garden. This is the most eco-friendly way to celebrate the holiday.

Remember, a little planning goes a long way in making sure we enjoy our food **without wasting it**.

## **4. How to Do Food Waste Management**

**Food waste management** isn‚Äôt just about saving money‚Äîit‚Äôs about protecting our planet. When food goes in the trash, it doesn‚Äôt just disappear. It ends up in landfills, where it releases **methane**, a powerful greenhouse gas that causes climate change.

### **The Best Way to Manage Food Waste: Use a Composter**

Using a **composter** at home is one of the simplest and most effective ways to turn your food waste into something useful‚Äî**rich compost for your garden**!

### **What Is Composting?**

Composting is the natural process of breaking down organic waste (like banana peels, coffee grounds, and leftover donuts) into a dark, nutrient-rich soil called compost.

### **Why Composting Is Good:**

1. **Improves soil health** in gardens and pots.
2. **Reduces landfill waste**, lowering pollution.
3. **Saves money** on fertilizer.
4. **Supports plants**, helping them grow better and stronger.

### **How to Start Composting at Home:**

1. **Get a composter** ‚Äîyou can find these at GEME.
2. **Collect kitchen scraps** like fruit peels, veggies, eggshells, and coffee grounds.
3. **Mix with yard waste** ‚Äîleaves, grass clippings, and twigs work well.
4. **Turn the** **GEME home composter on** ‚Äîwithin 6-8 hours, you‚Äôll have dark, crumbly compost ready to use! 

### **What‚Äôs** **NOT** **Recommended** **to Compost:**

‚ùå Meat and dairy

‚ùå Greasy foods

‚ùå Plastic or glass

‚ùå Pet waste

Using a composter at home is a **great way to manage food waste** responsibly. Not only do you reduce trash, but you also give back to nature. Although donuts are a bit greasy, a few of them like 2 or 3 are not a big deal for GEME electric composter. ‚úÖ

## **Conclusion**

**National Donut Day** is all about fun, flavor, and a bit of tradition. Whether you're visiting **Dunkin Donuts** for a free treat or making your own donuts at home, remember to celebrate responsibly. Don't let those delicious bites go to waste‚Äîshare, store, or repurpose your extras.

And most importantly, help our planet üåç by learning how to manage your food waste the right way. A simple composter in your kitchen or backyard can make a big difference. Let's enjoy our food, treat ourselves every now and then, and care for our environment all at once. üå≥
