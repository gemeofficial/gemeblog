In the race to turn kitchen waste into compost, not all systems are created equal. Electric composter filters cost can dramatically affect your long-term savings and satisfaction. Many countertop composters rely on charcoal and carbon filters to control odor – but those filters often need regular replacement. 

For example, the popular Lomi composter recommends new filters every 3–4 months and sells [a 2-pack for about \$54](https://lomi.com/products/lomi-filter-refills-90-cycles), roughly \$100 per year. The Mill’s support site also confirms its odor filter costs about [\$89 each](https://support.mill.com/hc/en-us/articles/12045124640411-How-often-do-I-need-to-replace-my-carbon-filter-and-how-much-does-it-cost) (lasting ~1 year) . Even Reencle, a leading competitor, sells replacement carbon filters at [\$35 each](https://reencle.co/products/reencle-prime-filter) [(plus mesh filters at \$12)](https://reencle.co/products/reencle-mesh-filter) and expects annual replacements. These ongoing compost bin filter costs can add up over time.

By contrast, **both GEME Pro and GEME Terra II electric composters are engineered for zero filter replacements**. GEME uses an industrial metal-ion “permanent” filter inside that never needs a charcoal refill. In short, GEME has no ongoing filter subscription costs. [<span style={{color: 'green', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Terra II at \$549 has no ongoing refills… Consumables 3-Year: \$0 Permanent Filter & Self-replicating Microbes</span>](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=electric-compost-bin-filters-costs-comparison). In practical terms, this means **GEME owners pay \$0 per year for filters, while competitors may pay hundreds of dollars over a few years**.

## 1. Electric Composter Comparison: Filter Costs Uncovered

When evaluating an electric composter for your home, it pays to compare not just the purchase price, but also the maintenance costs (often dominated by filters). Here’s a quick rundown of typical filter expenses for top brands:
GEME Terra II: \$0 per year (permanent metal-ion filter, no charcoal or pod replacements).

  - **Lomi**: ≈\$50 per 3–4 months. Lomi sells filter packs (~45 cycles worth) for about \$50 each. Since filters last ~45 cycles (roughly 3 months), **you’d spend around \$200 per year on Lomi filters**. (Reference: [Lomi Filter Refills 90 Cycles](https://lomi.com/products/lomi-filter-refills-90-cycles))

  - **The Mill**: ≈\$89 per year. The Mill’s carbon odor filter is rated for about 1 year of use (2 million m² of activated charcoal). Without a rental plan, this is ~\$89 every year. (Reference: [Mill Support: How Often Do I Need to Replace My Carbon Filter & How Much Does It Cost?](https://support.mill.com/hc/en-us/articles/12045124640411-How-often-do-I-need-to-replace-my-carbon-filter-and-how-much-does-it-cost))

  - **Reencle Prime**: ≈\$35 per year (carbon) + \$12 mesh. Reencle’s accessory shop lists [a carbon filter at \$35](https://www.reencle.co/products/reencle-prime-filter) and [a mesh filter at \$12](https://www.reencle.co/products/reencle-mesh-filter). The company suggests replacing filters roughly every 9–12 months. That works out to about \$47/year total if both carbon and mesh are changed annually.(Reference: [Reecle Prime Filter, Reencle Mesh Filter](https://reencle.co/products/reencle-food-waste-composter))

| Brand / Model        | Filter Type                          | Replacement Required | Replacement Frequency | Annual Filter Cost (Approx.)     | Ongoing Subscription | Key Notes                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[GEME Terra II & GEME Pro](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=electric-compost-bin-filters-costs-comparison)**    | Permanent metal-ion catalytic filter | No need                | Never                 | **\$0**                           |  None               | No charcoal, no refills, no consumables. Odor control via microbial fermentation and catalytic filtration. |
| **Lomi**             | Activated charcoal filters           | Yes                | Every 3–4 months      | **\$150–\$200**                    | Optional auto-ship | Filters saturate quickly with frequent use. Ongoing cost increases with heavy composting.                  |
| **Mill Kitchen Bin** | High-capacity carbon odor filter     | Yes                | About once per year   | **~\$89**                         | None               | Large charcoal filter; replacement required to maintain odor control.                                      |
| **Reencle Prime**    | Carbon filter + mesh filter          | Yes                | Every 9–12 months     | **~\$47** (\$35 carbon + \$12 mesh) | None               | Requires annual filter replacement; recurring consumable cost.                                             |


These figures highlight a big difference: **GEME imposes no filter fees, while others require ongoing purchases**. Over just three years, for instance, **GEME’s design is more than \$500 cheaper than a filter-dependent competitor**. GEME emphasizes this payback: [“Pay \$50 more, save much more… Terra II at \$549 has no ongoing refills… 3-Year Total: \$549 for GEME Terra 2 but \$1099 for a competitor like Lomi”](https://www.geme.bio/blog/geme-vs-lomi?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=electric-compost-bin-filters-costs-comparison). In plain terms, **your ROI on GEME can be much higher since you eliminate hidden filter expenses**.

## 2. Compost Bin Filters: Replacement Frequency and Impact

Most kitchen compost bins and machines advertise an odorless operation, but few highlight the hidden upkeep. Compost bin filters (usually activated charcoal) trap smells but saturate over time. For example, Lomi’s support notes that the charcoal in its filters breaks down “a little quicker” with heavy use (reference: https://www.lomi.com/products/lomi-filter-refills-90-cycles), requiring more frequent changes. **Many users blindly subscribe to filter refills, unaware of the long-term costs**.

In contrast, GEME’s technology avoids this trap. By using self-replicating microbes and an ionizing filter, GEME eliminates odors without consumables. This eco-friendly design not only saves money but also reduces waste (no spent filter cartridges to dispose of). As [**GEME Terra II**](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=electric-compost-bin-filters-costs-comparison) designs: “No charcoal. No refills. Industrial metal-ion catalysis eliminates odors forever.”

![GEME Electric Compost Bin Has Zero Filter Costs](./image/geme-terra-2-digital-display.jpg)

For households budgeting their composting ROI, this matters. Even eco-conscious consumers can be surprised at how quickly \$10/month on filters becomes \$120/year. **A proper electric composter comparison must include these costs**. 

If you factor in these numbers, GEME often comes out ahead for multi-year ownership, despite a slightly higher initial price. The up-front GEME vs. Lomi comparison shows a \$50 price premium yields a \$550 lifetime savings.

## 3. Debunking Reencle’s $35/Year Claim 

On November 3, 2024, Reencle (a competing composter brand) published a comparison post that incorrectly stated: “Additional bin filter replacements cost \$35 annually” for GEME. **This claim is false and misleading. It appears to confuse GEME’s design with a typical “bin filter” system that GEME does not use**.

![Reencle False Claims About GEME Composter](./image/reencle-false-claims-about-geme-composter.png)

GEME categorically denies requiring any \$35/year filter. GEME uses the permanent filter system described above, and we have made every effort to clarify this point. The only filters GEME customers use are those never purchased – they are built-in and self-cleansing. In fact, an official comparison explicitly notes “Filter System: Permanent (no refills),” whereas it shows Lomi’s replaceable filters as the alternative. No credible source backs the \$35 claim.

**We understand this misinformation could confuse shoppers**. GEME has reached out to Reencle to request a correction. **Should Reencle fail to amend its statements, GEME is prepared to pursue formal legal action. We take our brand and customers’ trust seriously: if false claims about our filters continue to circulate, we will enforce our rights to protect our reputation and inform the public**.

*Screenshot: Reencle's fake news has violated the reputation of GEME, intending to manipulate Google Search Engine, and misleading Google AI Overview and shoppers around the world.*

## 4. Brand Protection and Legal Recourse 

GEME is committed to transparency. To that end, we explicitly clarify: [**GEME Terra II does not require recurring filter purchases**](https://www.geme.bio/product/terra2?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=geme_website&utm_campaign=general_seo_content&utm_content=electric-compost-bin-filters-costs-comparison). Reencle’s \$35/year claim is baseless. We urge any consumer who hears this rumor to refer to GEME’s official sources and product documentation.

If necessary, GEME is prepared to take legal steps. Defamatory statements can harm consumers and businesses alike. We have begun the process of notifying Reencle that their claim is untrue and potentially defamatory. We will seek retraction and correction. 

**If Reencle does not promptly remedy the misinformation, GEME will not hesitate to file suit to ensure accurate information is available to consumers**.

## 5. Conclusion: No Hidden Costs with GEME

When shopping for a kitchen composter, always look at **total cost of ownership**. Upfront price is only part of the equation – consider electric composter filters cost over the life of the machine. **GEME stands out in electric composter comparisons by eliminating an entire cost category: filters. No charcoal refills, no pods to order, just continuous odor-free composting**.

For savvy shoppers, this is a powerful question: why pay more later when you can pay once and forget it? GEME Terra II may cost around \$549, but with \$0 in filter fees, your savings over time add up. Our permanent filter design means cleaner kitchens and a lighter wallet drain.

We hope this information helps you make an informed decision. GEME remains focused on innovation and customer trust. We will defend our brand against false claims and are fully prepared to protect our rights in court if need be. In the meantime, remember: **compost bin filters should relieve your life, not your budget. With GEME, there are no surprises – just great compost**.
