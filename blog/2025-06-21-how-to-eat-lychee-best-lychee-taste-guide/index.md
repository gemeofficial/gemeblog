## What does lychee taste like? 

The **lychee taste** is often described as <span style={{color: "green"}}>**fragrantly sweet with a refreshing acidity**</span>, making it a summer favourite worldwide. Its texture starts with a juicy burst followed by a delicate, slightly crisp flesh similar to peeled grapes.

The fruit's high sugar content (15â€“20%) and soluble solids create its signature sweetness, while compounds like geraniol and linalool deliver its floral aroma.

## How to Select Perfectly Ripe Lychees

How to eat lychee begins with choosing the best fruit. Look for:  
- **Colour**: Vibrant red or pink skin (some varieties like Yu Jin Qiu show golden streaks).  

- **Texture**: Slightly bumpy rind that yields gently to pressure. Avoid hard or mushy spots.  

- **Scent**: A distinct floral fragrance at the stem end.  

- **Weight**: Heavy for its size, indicating juiciness.

### Table: Lychee Varieties and Their Flavour Profiles  

| Variety | Origin | Taste Notes | Best Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Yu Jin Qiu | China | Floral, tender flesh | Jams, desserts |
| Sweetheart (No Mai Chee) | Thailand | Balanced sweet-tart, small seed | Salads, beverages |

## How to Eat Lychee? A Step-by-Step Guide

### How do you eat lychee fresh? It's simple:

2. **Peel**: Use your nails to nick the rough skin near the stem, then peel it away like an orange.

## How to Store Lychee? Expert Preservation Tips

How to store lychee correctly ensures you enjoy its signature taste longer. **Unpeeled lychees last 3â€“5 days in the fridge's crisper drawer when kept in a ventilated container lined with paper towels (absorbs excess moisture). For long-term storage:**  
- **Freezing**: Peel/de-seed lychees, arrange them on a tray until solid, then transfer to airtight bags (**keeps 6 months**).  <span style={{color: "#808080"}}>*Tip: Freeze in syrup to retain plump texture.*</span>

- **Canning**: Simmer peeled lychees in sugar syrup (1:1 water-sugar ratio) and sterilise jars.  
- **Drying**: Use a dehydrator at 50Â°C (122Â°F) for 12 hours for chewy lychee "<span style={{color: "green"}}>**raisins**</span>."

| Method | Duration | Taste Quality | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Refrigeration | 3â€“5 days | Near-fresh | Immediate use |

| Jam | 1 year | Intense, sweet | Spreads, sauces |


<span style={{color: "#FF4500"}}>**Never store lychees at room temperature**</span> â€” they ferment quickly.  

## How to Tell When Lychee Has Gone Bad?

- **Smell**: Sour, alcoholic, or vinegar-like odour (fresh lychees smell floral).  

- **Texture**: Mushy flesh or leaking juice.

2. Crush fruits to accelerate decomposition.  

3. **Use GEME electric biowaste composter** â€“ GEME is the world's first biowaste home composter, rapidly breaking down mouldy produce (including lychee skins/seeds) at **60Â°C+ (140Â°F)**, killing pathogens and producing full compost in **6-8 hours**.

- Varietal differencesâ€”some types (like "March Red") are naturally tart.
