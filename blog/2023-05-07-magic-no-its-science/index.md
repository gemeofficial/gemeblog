If we talk about GEME-Kobold, it is the unique of the world - the only one in the world with a proven high-temperature-resistant 
complex of natural microflora.

GEME-Kobold has been discovered and validated so far, which is an ancient microbiota with a long history that has gradually
achieved success after decades of development. It is also not an artificial microbiota developed through biotechnology.

We use GEME to provide the best conditions for its reproduction and decomposition, allowing it to break down and reproduce 
faster than in its natural environment.

Biological waste, especially food waste, is rich in protein components, which is a good organic fertilizer raw materials. 
In the optimal humidity, temperature and aerobic environment provided by GEME, GEME-Kobold maximizes the fastest possible 
reproduction and decomposition of organic waste, turning them into 95% clean air and 5% organic compost. These by-products
can be used not only for soil improvement but also to purify water bodies.
