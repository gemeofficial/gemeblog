# Fertilizer production using broad bean shells

![](./img/img.png)

Green broad bean pods are rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients, easy to collect in the city, clean, 
and sanitary.

When preparing, the pods can be dried, grinded and stored in reserve, in the production of potting soil, can be mixed 
into use, but also in the potted flower potting, planting as a base fertilizer application.

Of course, you can also use [GEME](https://www.geme.bio) to recycle your bio-waste and harvest your natural organic 
compost in 6-8 hours.

This organic compost increases and activates the microorganisms in the soil. In this way, the soil becomes a clump 
structure and the soil will become more permeable and breathable, thus promoting the growth of plants.
