## Step 3. Adjust the position
:::warning
In order to prevent the chain from falling off in the future, we suggest you adjust the screws around the small gear to make the chain tighter.
:::

Adjust the height of the small gear and make it a little bit lower than before, by which you can make the chain tighter.On the contrary, making it a little bit higher can make the chain looser
