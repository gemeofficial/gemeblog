# How to Check if the UV Light is On


## symptoms

When you have got a "ULOP" code, please check if the UV light is on.

If it is on, we will send you a UV lamp for replacement under the premise that you meet the warranty conditions, and provide you with the replacement steps.
It it is not, it should have a further troubleshoot to find out the solution.

‚≠êRemember to turn on the machine after open the small lid of uv light.
