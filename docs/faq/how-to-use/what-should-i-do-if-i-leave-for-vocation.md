# What Should I Do if I Leave for Vocation for a Period?


## Less than 2 weeks
It's OK. You don't have to do anything.
Kobold is not your cat or dog, they can take care of themselves easily.
Please do not unplug the power supply. Keep it run as usual.

## Longer than 15 days

:::info
Don't worry, you can store them and they will go into sleep mode, and reactivate and use again.
:::

1. When not in use for a long time, please store the product in a place with low humidity and good ventilation.

2. Make sure the bio-waste is completely decomposed. Stop feeding GEME 2 days before you clean up.
   If it is too wet or too much moisture, press the dehumidify button to run for 24hours. 
   Make sure there is as less water as possible, It is better for storage if the humidity is under 15% if you prefer to have a value measure it. 
   Then Seal the Microbiota (by-products) with a sealed bag.

3. Please unplug the power and clean the internal filter and inner cover.
   Kindly refer to the [cleaning method](./how-often-do-i-need-to-clean-geme#total-cleaning).

4. Seal the material(Kobold + by-product + small percentage unfinished food waste) with a sealed bag.

5. Keep them in a safe place.

6. Put the bag back into GEME Composter when you are back from vocation, add waster to reactivate them and [start using again](../../get-started).
