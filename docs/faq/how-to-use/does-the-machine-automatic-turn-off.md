# Does the Machine Automatic Turn off? Power Saving Mode?

No, GEME need to be connected with power 7x24.

## Why need 7x24?

Unlike other cycles based fake "electric composters", they need a period of time to cook and dehydrate food waste.
That's not a composting process. 

GEME's working principle is real composting with super microbe microorganisms - GEME Kobold. 
It will keep composting continuously, just like any natural composting process.
The machine is designed to provide the best environment for certain temperature, humidity and ventilation condition.
So GEME Kobold can keep working with the best performance.

By this design, there is no cycle concept. You don't have to wait for working cycle to be completed. 
You can add food waste into GEME at any time you need. 
The usage will be super easy, just like using any regular trash can.
Even your 5-years old kids can use it by intuition.

Say if the power is cut off, ventilation condition turn bad, anaerobic fermentation happen,
it could cause smell issue.

One more spec is we assume daily food waste is generated every day.

## Concern about power consumption?


We know, you might be concerned about power consumption.

However, the GEME composter is well-designed.
The major workload to breakdown food waste is by microbiota, not by the electric power itself. 
Its power is mainly used to maintain the basic environment for microbes to work best.

Let's compare the electric consumption between dehydrator "composter" and GEME composter.

| Power Usage    | GEME Composter | Dehydrator Composter |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Heating & Cook | -              | 300w+                |
| Grinding       | -              | 200w+                |
| Ventilation    | 30w+           | -                    |
| Filter System  | 10w            | -                    |
| Stir System    | 30w            | -                    |
| UV Light       | 7w             | -                    |
| Total          | 77w            | 500w+                |

> the watt is in average, not instantaneous power

Overall, the daily usage of GEME composter is slightly higher than a MacBook Pro laptop computer,  even though it is working 7x24.

:::caution
Restarting(power off and power on) the machine too frequently, will make the life of the machine shorter instead of better.
