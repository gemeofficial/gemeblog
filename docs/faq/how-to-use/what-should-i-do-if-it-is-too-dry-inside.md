# What Should I Do if it is Too Dry Inside?

Yes please.

## Why Too Dry is not Good?
You can add water if too dry. it won't harm and necessary.
Actually when the inside is too dry, that means the [GEME Kobold](../geme-kobold/what-is-kobold) will go to sleep mode again.
It is OK in most of the time, but less efficiency.

## How to Add Water?
When you add water, pour 400mL to 800mL.
Just avoid pouring too much water to make it like a swimming pool.

## How to Tell the Moisture of Kobold is Good Enough?
You can put some Kobold and compost in one of your hand. 
Grab them, if they can get shaped, then it is OK.
If they can not maintain some shapes, like the sands, then it still too dry.

## Only Water Allowed? Can I add other Liquid?
You know what? You can even add liquid waste, like your gumbo or soul. That will be better.
Just pouring them into the composter directly, so you don't have to add waster independently.
Making it the most convenience composter in the marketing.
