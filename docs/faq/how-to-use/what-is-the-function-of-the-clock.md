# What is the Function of the Screen when Close?

> When I open the lid, the clock resets to zero. What is the function of the clock? Is it just to show how long the unit has been closed or something more?


It's just showing how long it pass since the last time the lid close.
Usually, this is indicating how long the last time food waste started composting.
