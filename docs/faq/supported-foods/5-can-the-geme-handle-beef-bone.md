# Can the geme handle beef bones?

## Short Answer
No.

## Long Answer

No, usually bone takes longer time to breakdown, especially for bing bones like beef bones.
It takes years in the natural to breakdown the big bones maybe decades.  
In GEME it will be months. 
However, the problem is the bones might hurt the agitator shaft and make the machine broken. So better don't do that.
