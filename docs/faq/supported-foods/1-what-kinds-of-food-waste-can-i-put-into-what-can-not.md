## Long Answer

[GEME Kobold](../geme-kobold/what-is-kobold) is an all-natural complex of microorganisms from nature that can break down almost any bio waste that can be broken down in nature.

According to the EU definition of bio-waste, food waste, garden waste, by-products from food processing plants are all bio-waste.

However, the GEME is designed for indoor household use, so if you want to achieve fast composting results, then the waste you put in should be perishable food waste or other bio waste that has been broken.

Sometimes GEME Kobold can breakdown the food waste, but you need to care about the machine.

1. Avoid hard food waste, like bones and avocado seeds, they will hurt the machine.
2. Avoid fiber material, like vines or hair, they will wrap the rotor and hurt the machine.

## Bio Plastic

Well, this is debatable. For there is no unified standard to define how many percentage of bio material is contained in the plastic.
The GEME Kobold will only accept pure bio material. Therefor it's depends on the bio material containing percentage for the bio plastic. 
Like paper, contains organic bio material like bamboo, but some other material can not be well breakdown by GEME Kobold. Hence it is not encouraged.

## One More Thing

Pet feces also accepted. Dog & cat poops can go into GEME and there is no smell at all, and breakdown as fast as 2 hours.
