# Can I put coffee grinds/coffee grounds in GEME composter?

## Short Answer
If the are hot, don't.

Wait until they are cold down, yes you can!

## Long Answer
Coffee ground is perfect to be composted. Just avoid put them into GEME Composter when they are still hot.
The reason is when they are hot, some microbes in the GEME Kobold could be killed or damaged.
