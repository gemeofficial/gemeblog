# Can I put bones in GEME?

## Short Answer
Yes, of course you can, but we recommend small bones, such as chicken or fish.

## Long Answer

However, big bones are not recommended, it might hurt the mixer inside the machine.


If it's a large cartridge bone or something like that, you can put it in if you can crush it, otherwise please don't be too critical of how fast it gets broken down :)
