        controls height="100%"

    />
</div>


### Install Kobold

2. Open the GEME Composter lids.
3. Pour all the Kobold inside the container.

</div>


### Pour Watter
Put 800mL clean water into the container.

### Wait 6 to 24 hours
1. Plug and [power on](faq/how-it-works/is-it-necessary-to-keep-the-machine-powered-on.md).
   
2. Kindly wait for few hours, to let the microbes inside the Kobold material get activated.

## Start Daily Use
Now you can start using it just like any regular trash bin.

You might wonder what kind of food waste can put, what can not. Kindly refer to [compostable food waste guide](faq/supported-foods/what-kinds-of-food-waste-can-i-put-into-what-can-not).

Happy GEMEing!
